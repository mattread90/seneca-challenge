# Seneca Exercise - Cause & Effect Module

## Installation instructions

Clone this repo and, inside of the projects root directory, run the command 

```
npm install
```

I created this app using `create-react-native-app` to get up and running quickly. This uses Expo, which also makes it easy to view the app through the Expo app. If you are unfamiliar with Expo, please see instructions in `EXPO_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

Basically, if you have the Expo app on your phone (you can download it from the App store), run the command

```
npm start
```

and follow the Expo app instructions to scan the QR that should be generated in your console. The app will soon run on your device.

Alternatively, you can run

```
npm ios
```

to start the app on an iOS simulator if you are using a Mac.
